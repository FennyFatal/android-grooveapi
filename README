This project is intended to make a simple android API for accessing grooveshark.

Initializing a client and performing a search would look something like this:

	public class MyActivity implements GrooveApiAsyncReceiver {
		AsyncClient mAsyncClient = null;
	
		@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
			//Your Init code here.
			mAsyncClient = new AsyncClient(this);
		}

		@Override
		public void recieveClientAsync(Client c) {
			/*We are initialized here, now we can search, and since we made a new async client object we don't care
			* about the client object we got back. We would only use this if were using the async methods in a static way.
			*/
			mAsyncClient.doSearchAsync("song title");
		}

		@Override
		public void recievePlaylistAsync(final Playlist pl) {
			//Do stuff with the playlist we got back here.
		}

		@Override
		public void recievePlayURL(Song theSong,String url) {
			//Final method to satisfy implementation. This method would return the stream url that was called for asynchronously.
		}
	}
